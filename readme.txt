== Description ==
This plugin allow your visitors to attach imaged or other file to their comments as easily as possible. I designed it for http://langtreeshout.org. It also adds lightbox code for all inserted images.

== Installation ==
Just add to /wp-content/plugins and activate or use the automatic plugin installer. If you want to use it in Wordpress Mu for all blogs just copy comment-uploads.php to /wp-content/mu-plugins and leave the rest in place. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What license is this plugin available under? =

The GPLv3 of course :-). You can reuse it, hack it, redistibute it or do whatever else you like as long as you keep the source open under the same license.

= Does the plugin proform and checks on uploaded files? =

The answers to that question is sadly no, not until I get round to adding some (it is still in beta though). Uploaded files will however be bound by the global php settings for uploads which should limit file size but not file type.

= I have just thought of an amazing feature your plugin should have, what can I do? =

Good for you - send me and email or comment and if I like the idea, I will see whether my coding skills will streach to making it. If you have a patch or want to contribute then even better.

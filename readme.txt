Just add to /wp-content/plugins and activate or use the automatic plugin installer. If you want to use it in Wordpress Mu for all blogs just copy comment-uploads.php to /wp-content/mu-plugins and leave the rest in place or use the new activate site wide option for an much simpler installation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What license is this plugin available under? =

The GPLv3 of course :-). You can reuse it, hack it, redistribute it or do whatever else you like as long as you keep the source open under the same license. It is and will always be free for personal or commercial use but if you like it you can donate or pay me to work on the features you need. The plugin is supplied with no warranty whatsoever and any contributors will not be held responsible for any damages caused by its use.

= It does not work, what can I do? =

If you need help with the plugin then email me at tom.tdw@gmail.com and I will be more than willing to give any help I can.

= How can I help support the plugin's development? =

I develop the plugin in my free time whilst providing free support for it so if you enjoy using it and would like to support it then any donations would be gratefully received.

If you want to donate then you can do so securely using Paypal:
http://goo.gl/WFJP6

= Is it available in my language? =

Currently the plugin is available in English and 10 other languages but anyone can translate it using Wordpress's standard tools (see http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress for more information). If you translate the plugin then please email me the PO files so that other users can benefit from them as well.

Alternatively you can translate the plugin online using an easy web interface on launchpad:
https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/easy-comment-uploads/trunk

= Is it secure? =

The plugin will by default only allow certain types of files which are know to be safe to be uploaded, which should prevent the majority of upload related attacks and has been extensively tested to make sure it as safe as possible. However, as with any plugin, I cannot guarantee that vulnerabilities will not emerge in the future. 

In recent versions, many new security features have been added including NONCE checks, and configurable options to restrict file-types, file-sizes and the allowed frequency of uploads for each type of user.

As with all plugins, new versions include security fixes and resolve other bugs so I always recommend running the latest stable version.

= How can I enable Lightboxes =

If you install the Wordpress Lightbox plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightbox-2/) then all uploaded images may be displayed using Lightbox support.

= I have just thought of an amazing feature your plugin should have, what can I do? =

Good for you - send me and email or comment and if I like the idea, I will see whether I have time to implement it. If you have a patch or want to contribute then even better - just contact me with a brief introduction and I will add you as a contributor to the plugin.
